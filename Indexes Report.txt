I have created one index: idx_teams_team_id. This index is a B+ tree index and was created with the command: 
"CREATE INDEX idx_teams_team_id ON Teams(team_id);"

Verify the existence of the index:
"pragma index_info(idx_teams_team_id);"

This is an index on Teams.team_id. This index supports all the queries used in this project.
In my report generation, I use two queries: One to get player statistics and one to get team statistics.
In both, the Teams.team_id attribute is used.

In my report for player statistics, the user inputs a specific team id and a player id.
The query filters based on these two attributes and returns information about the specific player playing for that team.
The query can utilize this index by traversing the B+ tree to the leaf node pertaining to the user-inputed team_id,
and then quickly find the corresponding RID in the Teams table.

In my report for team statistics, the user inputs a range of matches played and points earned.
The query filters based on these attributes and returns isome summary statistics about all the teams that fit the criteria.
This query benefits from this index because the join between the Teams and Standings tables are based on team_id.
When an index is present on the team_id column, SQLite can use this index to speed up the join operation as it can quickly
find the corresponding RID in the Teams table to join.
